Use Immediate ACK when long-range performance of your network is most important to you. Burst ACK mode will lower overhead by not acknowledging every packet sent over the network. When there is a very good link between the Router and the client, Burst ACK can provide a throughput boost. If an application, such as streaming multiple high-data video streams, requires maximum bandwidth, use Burst ACK mode. Keep in mind that long-range performance may be affected when using Burst ACK mode.";

hlp_90 = "Using Encryption can help secure your wireless network. Only one type of security may be selected at a time. Therefore the customer must select a mode that is supported on all network devices on the wireless network. This Belkin product has 5 possible Security settings: 1) Disabled. No encryption is enabled in this mode. Open networks where all users are welcome sometimes prefer to not enable encryption. 2) WPA PSK - Home (no server). WPA (Wireless protected Access) PSK is a recent standards-based security technique where each packet of information is encrypted with a different code, or key. Since the key is constantly changing, WPA is very secure. There are two types of WPA, WPA-PSK (Pre-Shared Key), and WPA-Radius Server. Obviously the difference being that one requires a server and one does not. WPA-PSK is for home and small business users who do not have a server. The PSK encryption key is generated automatically from a string of characters or Pass Phrase. Obviously the biggest security risk in WPA PSK is if someone finds out your Pass Phrase. a. TKIP verses AES. WPA setup requires the user to select whether to encrypt using TKIP or AES. The WPA standard specifies TKIP, so that is the default. Additionally TKIP should provide better compatibility between wireless products from different vendors since many wireless products will never be upgraded to AES. AES is a new encryption technique based on the un-ratified 802.11i standard. New WPA standards are being considered using AES. Although AES is not as popular, some users may prefer to use this technique. Either way, all networks devices must use the same technique. b. Pre-Shared Key. Enter any word or phrase up to 40 characters. The same PSK must also be used for every other wireless network device on the network. Watch out for upper and lower case differences (\"n\" is different than \"N\".) Remember, the easiest way to break your security is for someone to guess your PSK. 3) 128-bit WEP. Until recently, 128-bit WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) was the standard for wireless encryption. If not all of your wireless devices support WPA, 128bit WEP still offers very good security option. It will require you to enter hex numbers, or you can generate them automatically. 4) 64-bit WEP. Belkin only recommends 64-bit mode on networks where some devices do not support either WPA or 128bit WEP. 5) WPA - Radius Server. (This mode is accessed from the Advanced Button). WPA server is only for networks using a Radius Server. All parameter for this mode should be obtained from the administrator of your Radius Server. Unlike WPA PSK, WPA server passes the key from the server to the clients instead of generating it automatically.";
